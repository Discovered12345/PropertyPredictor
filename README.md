## Inspiration
Housing affordability is a growing global issue, with rising prices making it difficult for individuals and families to secure stable housing. Inspired by UN SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities & Communities), we wanted to leverage AI and data science to provide an intelligent solution that helps homebuyers and investors make informed decisions. 
## What it does
Property Predictor is an AI-powered housing price forecasting tool that analyzes historical and real-time data to provide accurate cost estimations for homes in different locations.
## How we built it
We built Property Predictor using a combination of machine learning, data analytics, and cloud computing. 
## Challenges we ran into
One major challenge was data quality and availabilityâ€”housing data is often fragmented and varies across regions. We also had to optimize our AI model to balance accuracy and computational efficiency, especially when integrating multiple predictive factors. Lastly, we had to organize all our ideas together and actually put them together and create the website. This was very hard, as designing the website and making all the UI work took a lot of time. We also couldn't work together as a group for a lot of the time because of classes, sports, and other activities.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud of successfully developing a working prototype that can accurately predict housing prices using AI. Our model demonstrates the real-world potential of applying STEM for economic growth and sustainable development. We built a tool that can positively impact housing affordability and urban planning.
## What we learned
This project deepened our understanding of machine learning for real-world applications, particularly in economic, rural, and urban development. We learned the importance of data preprocessing, model evaluation, and UX design when developing AI-powered tools. Additionally, we gained insight into how AI can drive economic decision-making, reinforcing the role of STEM in solving global challenges.
## What's next for Property Predictor
Moving forward, we plan to enhance our model with more real-time data sources like market fluctuations. We also want to expand the tool into a web and mobile app to make it accessible to homebuyers and investors worldwide. Ultimately, we envision Property Predictor as a go-to AI assistant for affordable and sustainable housing decisions on a global scale.
